### Next Steps
- Ensure all scripts are executable by running `chmod +x` on each script.
- Test the functionality of each script to confirm they work as intended.
- Consider adding logging functionality to capture outputs and errors for better debugging.
- If you encounter any issues, check the API responses and ensure the server is running correctly.

If you need help with specific parts of the scripts or further enhancements, feel free to ask!
