why isn't the app running

MR

Looking at the workflow states, I can see that the "Start application" workflow is running but outputting many console errors from a browser extension (those "Attempting to use a disconnected port object" errors). However, the actual application isn't starting because the workflow is running npm run dev:client instead of npm run dev.

The issue is that the Run button is set to execute the "Sultan Wallet Dev" workflow (which runs npm run dev), but that workflow is not_started. Instead, a different workflow "Start application" is running with the wrong command.

Let me fix this by ensuring the correct workflow runs when you click the Run button:

Set
Sultan Wallet Dev
to run
npm run dev
After this change, click the Run button at the top of the screen. The app should start on port 5000 and open in the webview.

Note: Those browser extension errors you're seeing are harmless - they're from a browser extension trying to connect and have nothing to do with your wallet app. The error handling in src/main.tsx is already filtering these out.

How can i publish this PWA to sltn.io/wallet because this is an ancillary project to sltn.io which is already deployed and separate but i'd like that /wallet url to point to this project, is that possible?

Yes, you can definitely publish this PWA to sltn.io/wallet! Since sltn.io is already deployed, you have a couple of options:

Option 1: Deploy as a Subdomain (Recommended)
The easiest approach is to deploy this as a subdomain like wallet.sltn.io instead of a path. This is the standard approach for deploying separate applications. Here's how:

Deploy this Repl using Static Deployments (since it's a PWA)
Link the custom domain wallet.sltn.io to this deployment
Let me help you configure the deployment settings:

Set deployment build command to
npm run build
and run command to
After this is configured:

Click the Deploy button at the top right
Choose Static deployment type
After deployment completes, go to the Deployments tab → Settings → Domains
Click "Link a domain" and enter wallet.sltn.io
Add the DNS records (A and TXT) to your domain registrar where sltn.io is hosted
Wait for DNS propagation (usually a few minutes)
Option 2: Reverse Proxy on Main Site
If you really need it at sltn.io/wallet, you'd need to modify your main sltn.io deployment to add a reverse proxy that forwards /wallet/* requests to this PWA's deployment URL. However, this is more complex and can cause issues with:

Client-side routing (React Router)
Asset paths (CSS, JS, images)
Service workers for PWA functionality
I strongly recommend Option 1 (subdomain) as it's cleaner, easier to maintain, and follows standard web architecture patterns.

Would you like me to help you set up the subdomain deployment?

Yes please help me set up the subdomain

Great! Let me help you set up the subdomain wallet.sltn.io for your Sultan Wallet PWA deployment.

Since you've already applied the deployment configuration, the next steps are:

1. Deploy Your Repl
First, let's deploy your Repl. Click the Deploy button at the top right of your workspace. In the Deployments pane, you should see that it's configured for a Static deployment with:

Build command: npm run build
Public directory: dist/public
Click "Deploy" to create your first deployment. This will:

Run npm run build to compile your PWA
Serve the static files from dist/public
Give you a deployment URL like https://sultan-wallet.replit.app
2. Link Your Custom Domain
Once the deployment is live:

In the Deployments pane, go to Settings → Domains
Click "Link a domain"
Enter wallet.sltn.io
Click "Next"
Replit will generate DNS records for you:

An A record pointing to Replit's IP address
A TXT record for domain verification
3. Add DNS Records to Your Domain Registrar
Log in to wherever you manage DNS for sltn.io (e.g., Cloudflare, Namecheap, etc.)
Navigate to the DNS management section
Add the two records Replit provides:
A Record:

Hostname: wallet (for the subdomain)
Points to: The IP address Replit provides
TTL: Auto or 300 seconds
TXT Record:

Hostname: wallet
Value: The verification string Replit provides
TTL: Auto or 300 seconds
Save the changes
4. Wait for DNS Propagation
DNS propagation typically takes a few minutes but can take up to 24-48 hours. You can check the status at https://whatsmydns.net/ by entering wallet.sltn.io and selecting the A record type.

Once propagated, Replit will automatically verify your domain and provision an SSL certificate. Your wallet will then be accessible at https://wallet.sltn.io!

Note: Make sure you're adding the records for the subdomain wallet.sltn.io, not the root domain sltn.io. The hostname field should be wallet, not @.

Let me know once you've clicked Deploy and I can help with any issues that come up!

Looking at your deployment setup and DNS records, I can see that:

Your deployment is live at https://node-hub--MrChio.replit.app
You already have DNS records for www.sltn.io and @ (root domain) pointing to a different deployment
You want to add wallet.sltn.io subdomain for this Sultan Wallet PWA
Perfect! Here's what you need to do:

Step 1: Link the Domain in Replit Deployments
Go to your Deployments pane in this Repl
Under Settings → Domains, click "Link a domain"
Enter: wallet.sltn.io
Click "Next"
Replit will give you two DNS records to add.

Step 2: Add DNS Records to Your Domain Registrar
Based on what Replit provides, you'll need to add these records to your sltn.io DNS (where you manage the DNS records you showed me):

A Record:

Type: A
Name: wallet
Content: [IP address Replit provides]
TTL: 300 or 1800 (match your existing TTL pattern)
TXT Record:

Type: TXT
Name: wallet
Content: [verification string Replit provides]
TTL: 3600 (match your existing pattern)
Important Notes
Don't delete any existing records - you're just adding new ones for the wallet subdomain
The hostname is wallet, not @ or www
Wait for DNS propagation - usually 5-15 minutes, but can take up to 48 hours
Check propagation at https://whatsmydns.net/ by entering wallet.sltn.io and selecting A record
Once the DNS records propagate, Replit will automatically verify your domain and provision an SSL certificate. Your Sultan Wallet will then be accessible at https://wallet.sltn.io! 🎉

Let me know once you've clicked "Link a domain" in the Deployments pane, and I can help if you encounter any issues!

this is what replit gives: DNS Records
Next, add the following records to your domain's DNS settings. Learn more
Type Hostname Record
A
wallet
34.111.179.208

Perfect! Replit has provided you with the DNS records you need to add to your domain registrar where you manage sltn.io.

Now you need to go back to your domain registrar (where you showed me those DNS records earlier) and add these two new records for the wallet subdomain:

DNS Records to Add
1. A Record:

Type: A
Name/Hostname: wallet
Content/Value: 34.111.179.208
TTL: 1800 (or 300 to match your existing pattern)
2. TXT Record:

Type: TXT
Name/Hostname: wallet
Content/Value: replit-verify=1ec39d3b-fb82-4931-bd16-70b112f0b8cd
TTL: 3600 (to match your existing TXT records)
Important Notes
The hostname should be wallet (not @ or www)
Make sure you're adding these to the same place where you manage the other DNS records for sltn.io that you showed me earlier
After adding these records, it typically takes 5-15 minutes for DNS to propagate (but can take up to 24-48 hours in rare cases)
Once you've added these records and they've propagated, Replit will automatically verify the domain and provision an SSL certificate. Your Sultan Wallet will then be accessible at https://wallet.sltn.io! 🎉

You can check the propagation status at https://whatsmydns.net/ by entering wallet.sltn.io and selecting the A record type.

Let me know once you've added the records to your DNS provider!

why not 14400?

MR

MrChio

Looking at your DNS records, I can see you have a mix of TTL values:

Some are 300 seconds (5 minutes)
Some are 1800 seconds (30 minutes)
Some are 3600 seconds (1 hour)
Some are 14400 seconds (4 hours)
You're right - using TTL 14400 would be perfectly fine and would match the pattern you already have for your CAA records and some TXT records!

The TTL I suggested (1800 for A record, 3600 for TXT) was just to match the pattern of your existing A records and TXT records, but there's no technical reason you can't use 14400 for both.

Here's what to add with TTL 14400:

DNS Records to Add
1. A Record:

Type: A
Name/Hostname: wallet
Content/Value: 34.111.179.208
TTL: 14400 ✅
2. TXT Record:

Type: TXT
Name/Hostname: wallet
Content/Value: replit-verify=1ec39d3b-fb82-4931-bd16-70b112f0b8cd
TTL: 14400 ✅
Note: A longer TTL (14400 = 4 hours) means:

✅ Faster DNS lookups after initial propagation (cached longer)
❌ Slower to update if you need to change the IP address later
For a production subdomain that won't change often, 14400 is a great choice. Go ahead and use it!

These are the current dns records for sltn.io:

MR

Perfect! I can see you've successfully added the DNS records for wallet.sltn.io! 🎉

Looking at your DNS records, I can confirm:

✅ A Record for wallet → 34.111.179.208 (TTL: 14400)
✅ TXT Record for wallet → "replit-verify=1ec39d3b-fb82-4931-bd16-70b112f0b8cd" (TTL: 14400)

Both records are correctly configured and match exactly what Replit provided. Now you just need to wait for:

DNS Propagation
The DNS records typically propagate within 5-15 minutes, though it can occasionally take up to 24-48 hours. You can check the propagation status at:

https://whatsmydns.net/

Enter: wallet.sltn.io
Select: A record type
Check if the IP 34.111.179.208 appears globally
Next Steps
Once DNS propagates, Replit will:

Automatically verify your domain ownership (using the TXT record)
Provision an SSL certificate (so you'll have HTTPS)
Make your Sultan Wallet accessible at https://wallet.sltn.io
You can monitor the verification status in your Replit Deployments pane → Settings → Domains. It should show "Verified" once complete.

Regarding the console errors you're seeing ("Attempting to use a disconnected port object" and "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'ton')"):

These appear to be from a browser extension (likely a crypto wallet extension like TON Keeper based on the error referencing .ton). These errors are not from your PWA - they're from the extension trying to interact with the page. You can safely ignore them as they won't affect your Sultan Wallet functionality.

Your PWA is running correctly! Once the DNS propagates and Replit verifies the domain, you'll be all set at https://wallet.sltn.io! 🚀

why isn't the app running?

Looking at your workflow states, I can see that your app is actually running!

The "Sultan Wallet Dev" workflow is actively running and Vite has successfully started on port 5173:

VITE v6.4.1  ready in 358 ms
➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
➜  Network: http://172.31.64.226:5173/
However, I notice you're running on port 5173 (Vite's default), but your deployment configuration and server setup expect port 5000 (as shown in .replit with PORT = "3000" and server/index.ts defaulting to port 5000).

The console errors you're seeing ("Attempting to use a disconnected port object" and "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'ton')") are NOT from your app - they're from a browser extension (likely TON Keeper crypto wallet extension). These are being filtered out by the error handlers in src/main.tsx.

To access your app:
Since you're in development mode, you should be able to access your Sultan Wallet at:

The webview should automatically point to the right port
Or click the URL in the console output
The app is working fine - those extension errors are just noise from your browser extension trying to inject itself into the page. Your PWA is running correctly! 🎉

Looking at your workflow states, I can see that "Sultan Wallet Dev" is actually running successfully! The Vite dev server started on port 5173:

VITE v6.4.1  ready in 358 ms
➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
The issue is that the webview is probably looking at a different port. Let me check your configuration:

Your .replit file has PORT = "3000" set, and your server/index.ts defaults to port 5000, but Vite is running on port 5173 (its default).

The problem is that the "Sultan Wallet Dev" workflow just runs npm run dev, which starts only the Vite dev server (no backend). However, your app expects the backend server to be running to handle requests properly.

You should be clicking the Run button which is configured to run "Sultan Wallet Dev", and then the webview should automatically detect port 5173. If that's not working, let me propose a fix to ensure the backend server starts properly:

Set
Sultan Wallet Dev
to run
npm run dev
However, the real issue is that your deployment is configured as deploymentTarget = "static" in .replit, which means it's expecting just static files, but you have a backend server in server/index.ts.

Try this: After the workflow is running, click on the Webview tab and make sure it's pointing to the correct URL. The Vite server should be accessible, and you should see your Sultan Wallet app.

If you're still seeing "Your app is not running", try:

Stop the current workflow
Click the Run button again
Wait for the Vite server to fully start (you'll see the "ready in X ms" message)
The webview should automatically refresh and show your app
The console errors you're seeing are from a browser extension (TON Keeper), not your app - you can safely ignore those.

Looking at your setup, I can see the issue now. Your project has a backend server (server/index.ts) that needs to run, but your deployment is configured as "static" which only serves static files.

Yes, you should change your deployment type.

Your Sultan Wallet has:

A Vite frontend (React PWA)
An Express backend server in server/index.ts
This means you need a deployment that can run your backend server continuously. You have two options:

Option 1: Reserved VM Deployment (Recommended)
This will run your full-stack app (frontend + backend) together. The backend serves the frontend in production.

To switch:

Go to the Deployments tab
Delete the current Static Deployment
Create a new Reserved VM or Autoscale Deployment
The deployment will automatically use the build command from .replit: npm run build
It will run: node dist/index.cjs (your built server)
Option 2: Keep Static (Remove Backend)
If you don't actually need the backend server and just want a pure client-side PWA, you'd need to remove the server/ directory and all backend code.

Why the webview shows "Your app is not running"
Your current "Sultan Wallet Dev" workflow runs only npm run dev, which starts Vite on port 5173. However:

The .replit file sets PORT = "3000"
Your backend expects port 5000
The webview is probably looking at port 3000 or 5000, not 5173
The Vite dev server is running on port 5173, but the webview URL might be misconfigured.

Quick fix for development:

Try accessing your app by manually opening the webview and changing the port to 5173, or use the network URL shown in the console:

http://172.31.64.226:5173/
But for production deployment, switch from Static to Reserved VM since you have a backend server. Your DNS records are already set up correctly for wallet.sltn.io - once you create a Reserved VM deployment, it will work at that subdomain.

which is better for this pwa wallet, the reserved vm or autoscale?

MR

MrChio

Looking at your Sultan Wallet PWA, I'd recommend Reserved VM Deployment for the following reasons:

Why Reserved VM is Better for Your Wallet:
1. Backend Server Required
Your PWA has an Express backend (server/index.ts) that needs to run continuously. This server:

Serves the static files in production
Handles API routes (from registerRoutes)
Is configured to run on port 5000
2. Cost Certainty
With a wallet app, you likely want predictable costs rather than usage-based billing. Reserved VM gives you:

Fixed monthly cost
No surprises from traffic spikes
99.9% uptime guarantee
3. Autoscale Limitations for Your Use Case
Autoscale isn't ideal because:

It's designed for pure HTTP request/response servers - your app has a backend that does more than just handle requests
It aggressively throttles CPU outside request processing - if your server does any background activities, this would be problematic
It charges per request + execution time - not optimal for a wallet that users may keep open for extended periods
4. WebSocket Considerations
If you plan to add real-time features (like live balance updates or transaction notifications), Reserved VM handles persistent connections better. Autoscale charges for the entire duration a WebSocket is open.

Recommendation:
Use Reserved VM with the 0.5 vCPU / 1 GiB RAM tier to start. This gives you:

Enough resources for your Express + Vite setup
Continuous operation for your backend
Cost certainty (~$7-10/month range typically)
99.9% uptime for your production wallet
Your DNS is already configured correctly for wallet.sltn.io, so once you create a Reserved VM deployment and link that domain, you'll be all set! 🚀

it wants me to provide a run command:

Looking at your project setup, I can see the issue. Your Sultan Wallet has a backend server that serves the frontend in production, but you're creating a Reserved VM deployment.

Based on your .replit configuration, the build command is already set to npm run build, which is correct.

For the Run command, you need to start the production server that will serve your built application. Looking at your server/index.ts, it's designed to serve the static files when NODE_ENV === "production".

Use this run command:

node dist/index.cjs
This is what happens when you build:

npm run build compiles TypeScript and builds both the Vite frontend (to dist/public/) and the Express server (to dist/index.cjs) via script/build.ts
The server at dist/index.cjs will serve the static files from dist/public/ in production mode
It automatically uses the correct port from the environment
So your deployment configuration should be:

Build command: npm run build (already set)
Run command: node dist/index.cjs
This will start your Express server which will serve both the API routes and the built frontend on the port assigned by Replit (which will be mapped to port 80/443 externally).
