#### Week 7-8: Launch Preparation
- [ ] Token distribution mechanism
- [ ] Validator onboarding
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Community launch

## The Truth

**You have a working DEMO, not a blockchain.**

Your demo shows the CONCEPT works, but mainnet needs:
- Real consensus (not simulated)
- Actual block production
- True P2P networking
- Persistent state
- Security guarantees

## Recommendation

1. **Continue using testnet for marketing** ✅
2. **Focus on fixing core issues** 
3. **Don't rush mainnet** - it needs to be secure
4. **Consider getting help** - this is complex

## Realistic Timeline

**Mainnet Launch: 6-8 weeks minimum**

With current resources and assuming full-time work.
