### Next Steps
- Ensure all scripts are executable by running `chmod +x` on each script.
- Test the entire workflow from starting the testnet to running the tests and generating reports.
- Consider adding logging functionality to capture outputs and errors for better debugging.

If you need help with specific parts of the scripts or further enhancements, feel free to ask!
