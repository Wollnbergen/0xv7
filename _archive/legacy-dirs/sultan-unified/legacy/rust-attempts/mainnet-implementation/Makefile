It looks like you've been working on a series of scripts for managing and testing the Sultan Chain testnet. Here’s a summary of the key components and functionalities you've created:

1. **Test Scripts**:
   - **TEST_RUNNING_TESTNET.sh**: Tests the status, economics, and transfer functionalities of the Sultan Chain testnet.
   - **TEST_ALL_FEATURES.sh**: A comprehensive test suite that checks various features like zero gas fees, validator rewards, and economics model.

2. **Dashboard and Monitoring**:
   - **SULTAN_DASHBOARD.sh**: A live dashboard script that continuously checks the status of the Sultan Chain and displays metrics.
   - **STATUS_REPORT.sh**: Generates a complete status report of the Sultan Chain, including system status and live metrics.

3. **API Management**:
   - **sultan_api_v2.js**: An improved API server that handles requests and provides responses for various methods like `get_status` and `get_economics`.

4. **Project Management**:
   - **sultan_manager**: A management script that allows you to start, stop, check status, run tests, open the web interface, and view logs.

5. **Quick Reference**:
   - **QUICK_REFERENCE.txt**: A quick reference guide for commands and access points related to the Sultan Chain.

6. **Web Interface**:
   - Scripts to open the Sultan Chain testnet in the default web browser.

### Next Steps
- Ensure all scripts are executable by running `chmod +x` on each script.
- Test the functionality of each script to confirm they work as intended.
- Consider adding logging functionality to capture outputs and errors for better debugging.
- If you haven't already, set up a version control system (like Git) to track changes and collaborate with others.
