### Next Steps
- Ensure all scripts are executable by running `chmod +x /workspaces/0xv7/*.sh /workspaces/0xv7/sultan_manager`.
- Test the functionality of each script to confirm they work as intended.
- Consider adding logging functionality to capture outputs and errors for better debugging.
- If you encounter any issues, check the API server logs or the output of the scripts for troubleshooting.
