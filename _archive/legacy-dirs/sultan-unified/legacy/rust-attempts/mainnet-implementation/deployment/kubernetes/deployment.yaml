It looks like you've been working on a series of scripts for managing and testing the Sultan Chain testnet. Here's a summary of the key components you've created:

1. **Test Scripts**:
   - `TEST_RUNNING_TESTNET.sh`: Tests the status, economics, and transfer functionalities of the testnet.
   - `TEST_ALL_FEATURES.sh`: A comprehensive test suite that checks various features of the Sultan Chain.

2. **Dashboard and Monitoring**:
   - `SULTAN_DASHBOARD.sh`: A live dashboard script that continuously displays the status and metrics of the Sultan Chain.

3. **Status Reports**:
   - `STATUS_REPORT.sh`: Generates a complete status report of the Sultan Chain, including system status and live metrics.

4. **Manager Script**:
   - `sultan_manager`: A management script that allows you to start, stop, check status, run tests, open the web interface, and view logs.

5. **Quick Reference**:
   - `QUICK_REFERENCE.txt`: A quick reference guide for commands and access points related to the Sultan Chain.

6. **API Server**:
   - `sultan_api_v2.js`: An improved API server script that handles requests and provides responses for various functionalities.

7. **Browser Integration**:
   - Scripts to open the Sultan Chain testnet in the default web browser.

### Next Steps
- Ensure all scripts are executable by running `chmod +x` on each script.
- Test the functionality of each script to confirm they work as intended.
- Consider adding logging to your scripts for better debugging and monitoring.
- If you encounter any issues, check the API responses and ensure the server is running correctly.
