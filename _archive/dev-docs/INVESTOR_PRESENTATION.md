# Sultan Chain - Investor Presentation

## Current Status: PROTOTYPE/DEMO
**NOT YET LAUNCHED - Week 6 of 8-week development plan**

### ✅ What We've Built (Proven Concepts)
- **Zero Fee Mechanism**: Working in test environment
- **Economics Model**: 13.33% APY mathematically proven
- **API/Interface**: Live demo available
- **Technical Architecture**: Designed and partially implemented

### 🔧 What We're Building (In Progress)
- Multi-node consensus (60% complete)
- Real validator network (0 validators currently)
- Production infrastructure (planning phase)
- Security features (basic implementation)

### ❌ What We Need (Not Started)
- **Validators**: Need to recruit 20-100 initial validators
- **Funding**: Infrastructure and development costs
- **Security Audit**: $50K-100K for professional audit
- **Legal Structure**: Token regulatory compliance
- **Marketing**: Community building and awareness

### 💰 Investment Opportunity
**Seeking**: Seed funding for mainnet launch
**Use of Funds**:
- Infrastructure: $50K (servers, bandwidth)
- Security Audit: $75K (CertiK or similar)
- Development Team: $200K (6 months)
- Marketing: $75K (launch campaign)
- Legal/Compliance: $100K
**Total**: $500K seed round

### 📊 Realistic Timeline
- **Now**: Working prototype (50% complete)
- **Week 7-8**: Complete core development
- **Month 3**: Security audit
- **Month 4**: Validator recruitment
- **Month 5**: Testnet with real validators

### 🎯 Key Differentiators
1. **Actually Zero Fees** (not "low" fees)
